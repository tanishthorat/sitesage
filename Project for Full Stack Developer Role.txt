Project for Full Stack Developer Role at Madeline & Co.  
SiteSage — Automated SEO Performance Analyzer 
Overview 
Build a production-grade web platform that analyzes website URLs for SEO and performance quality. 
The system should crawl a given URL, extract key metadata (title, meta description, images, heading tags, 
etc.), evaluate basic performance metrics (load time, accessibility, best practices), and generate a structured 
SEO report. 
An AI-powered component should convert raw metrics into human-readable insights and optimization 
suggestions. 
Both the frontend and backend must be fully functional, modular, tested, containerized, and deployed with an 
automated CI/CD pipeline. 
This project assesses end-to-end engineering capability — architecture, development discipline, automation, 
and pragmatic use of AI. 
Tech Stack 
● Frontend: Next.js, React.js, TailwindCSS 
● Backend: FastAPI (Python), LangChain (for AI orchestration) 
● Database: PostgreSQL with Alembic for migrations 
● Storage: AWS S3 (or mock equivalent for static report files) 
● Vector DB (optional): Qdrant (for AI embeddings if used) 
● Containerization: Docker + Docker Compose 
● CI/CD: GitHub Actions (preferred) 
● Testing: Pytest / Jest with automated pipeline execution 
● Deployment: Render / Railway / AWS / Vercel (both frontend and backend required) 
Core Features (Required) 
1. URL Audit & Data Collection 
● User submits one or more website URLs via the frontend. 
● Backend asynchronously crawls and extracts: 
○ Title, meta tags, H1/H2 structure 
○ Image alt tags 
○ Page speed / accessibility metrics (via Python libraries or APIs like Lighthouse CI, 
requests-html, or aiohttp) 
● All results stored in PostgreSQL. 
2. SEO Analysis & Scoring 
● Backend computes an SEO score based on extracted attributes. 
● Includes basic checks such as missing alt tags, broken links, duplicate titles, and missing meta 
descriptions. 
3. AI Insight Generation 
● Use an LLM (via LangChain or direct API) to: 
○ Summarize site quality in 2–3 paragraphs 
○ Suggest 3–5 actionable improvements 
● Minimal prompt engineering required. 
4. Report Generation & Delivery 
● Return report in structured JSON via API. 
● Optional endpoint to download PDF report (bonus). 
● Include SEO score, metrics, and AI-generated text. 
5. Frontend Dashboard 
● Modern dashboard UI with: 
○ Form to submit URLs 
○ Display of reports in tabular and card view 
○ Responsive design 
○ Loading states and proper API error handling 
6. CI/CD, Testing & Deployment 
● CI/CD Pipeline: 
○ Run linting, unit tests, and integration tests on every push. 
○ Auto-deploy to production once tests pass. 
● Automated Tests: 
○ Unit + integration tests for both backend and frontend. 
○ AI-assisted testing tools allowed. 
● Dockerization: 
○ Both frontend and backend must run in containers using Docker Compose. 
Bonus / Optional Features 
● Multi-URL batch analysis with summary comparison. 
● Historical report tracking (trends over time). 
● Authentication and role-based access control. 
● Enhanced PDF styling (charts, tables, colored sections). 
● Custom AI prompt configuration in UI.
